## Overview

>> Distill and write up...
Is this sh!t even Spring MVC or is it bloody spring boot?!

## Thymeleaf
* Thymeleaf is a java templating engine, replaces JSP's (Java Server Pages)
    * Not a web framework in of itself
* it takes a template and converts it to HTML
* Thymeleaf is a natural template engine - this means that it can be rendered in the browser (without a Tomcat server, for example)
    * This contrasts JSP's which cannot be viewed properly in the browser alone...
