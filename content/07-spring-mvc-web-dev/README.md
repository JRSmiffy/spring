Is this sh!t even Spring MVC or is it bloody spring boot?!

## Thymeleaf
* Thymeleaf is a Java templating engine, replaces JSP's (Java Server Pages)
    * It is not a Web Framework in of itself
    * It takes a template and converts it to HTML
* Thymeleaf is a natural template engine:
    * This means that it can be rendered in the browser (without a Tomcat server, for example)
        * This contrasts JSP's which cannot be viewed properly in the browser alone
