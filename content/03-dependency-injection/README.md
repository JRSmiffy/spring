## The SOLID Principles of OOP
* Dr Bob's five principles of effective object-oriented design:

#### Single Responsibility
* Each class should have exactly one responsiblility
* This is broken if a class has more than one reason to change
* In general, classes should be small; large classes should be split into smaller ones
* Note, the class-level has been used to illustrate the point here but the same applies from the field and method levels all the way up to the level of micro-services

#### Open Closed

#### Liskov Substitution

#### Interface Segregation

#### Dependency Inversion
